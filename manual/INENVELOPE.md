| Description    | Usage |
|:--------|:--------:|
| This quantity can be used to calculate functions of the distribution of collective variables for the atoms that lie in a region where the density of a certain type of atom is high. | ![used in 0 tutorials](https://img.shields.io/badge/tutorials-0-red.svg)![used in 0 eggs](https://img.shields.io/badge/nest-0-red.svg)|
 | **output value** | **type** |
| vector of numbers between 0 and 1 that measure the degree to which each atom is within the volume of interest | scalar |

## Output components

This action can calculate the quantities in the following table when the associated keyword is included in the input for the action. These quantities can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Keyword | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| lessthan | scalar | LESS_THAN | the number of cvs in the region of interest that are less than a certain threshold | 
| morethan | scalar | MORE_THAN | the number of cvs in the region of interest that are more than a certain threshold | 
| between | scalar | BETWEEN | the number of cvs in the region of interest that are within a certain range | 
| sum | scalar | SUM | the sum of all the colvars weighted by the function that determines if we are in the region | 
| mean | scalar | MEAN | the average values of the colvar in the region of interest |
