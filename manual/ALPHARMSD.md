## Output components

This action calculates the quantities in the following table.  These quantities can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|
| struct | scalar | the vectors containing the rmsd distances between the residues and each of the reference structures | 
| lessthan | scalar | the number blocks of residues that have an RMSD from the secondary structure that is less than the threshold | 


## Input

The input for this action is specified using one or more of the keywords in the following table.

| Keyword |  Type | Description |
|:--------|:------:|:-----------|
| RESIDUES | atoms | this command is used to specify the set of residues that could conceivably form part of the secondary structure |
