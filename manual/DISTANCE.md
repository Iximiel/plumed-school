## Output components

This action can calculate the quantities in the following table when the associated keyword is included in the input for the action. These quantities can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity required from the list below.

| Name | Type | Keyword | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:----:|:-------|
| x | scalar | COMPONENTS | the x-component of the vector connecting the two atoms | 
| y | scalar | COMPONENTS | the y-component of the vector connecting the two atoms | 
| z | scalar | COMPONENTS | the z-component of the vector connecting the two atoms | 
| a | scalar | SCALED_COMPONENTS | the normalized projection on the first lattice vector of the vector connecting the two atoms | 
| b | scalar | SCALED_COMPONENTS | the normalized projection on the second lattice vector of the vector connecting the two atoms | 
| c | scalar | SCALED_COMPONENTS | the normalized projection on the third lattice vector of the vector connecting the two atoms |
